            <h2 id="About">About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a passionate Frontend Developer with a strong foundation in web development technologies. I take
                great joy in crafting engaging and interactive user experiences through well-structured HTML, stylish
                CSS, and dynamic JavaScript.</p>
            <p><br>My journey in the world of web development began during my studies at NUML, Islamabad, where I was
                introduced to the exciting realm of coding and design. I quickly realized that I had found my true
                passion and embarked on a mission to master the art of frontend development.</p>
            <p><br>During my academic journey, I gained valuable insights into modern programming practices and design
                principles, allowing me to create intuitive and visually appealing websites that capture users'
                attention. I honed my skills through hands-on projects, experimenting with layout design, animation, and
                interactivity to bring ideas to life.</p>
            <p><br>Driven by a curiosity to explore the latest trends in frontend development, I have actively
                participated
                in online communities and forums, engaging with fellow developers to share knowledge and stay updated
                with industry advancements. This drive led me to take on freelance projects where I collaborated with
                clients to transform their visions into functional and visually striking websites.</p>
            <p><br>My goal is to contribute my expertise to innovative projects that challenge me to push my boundaries
                and
                provide opportunities for continuous learning. I am committed to creating seamless user experiences,
                adhering to best practices, and staying up-to-date with emerging technologies in the ever-evolving field
                of web development.</p>
